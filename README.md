Data mining of Academic Performance in Portuguese Secondary Schools

This dataset consists of the academic performance in two Portuguese secondary schools. In total, there are 33 attributes which relate to student grades, demographic, school related features, and social habits. The data was collected using school reports and questionnaires. There are two datasets related to the academic performance in two specific subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por) (University of Minho, & Cortez, P, 2014).

Goal
The goal of this project is to use supervised machine learning regression algorithms to the chosen datasets to research how the various predictors affect students'92 grades. Methods applied will include Random Forest Regression and GridSearchCV.

Specifications
Python will be used as the main software, as Python is well-suited for supervised machine learning. Neural networks, XGBoost, and other more advanced algorithms won't be used due to the simplicity of the data and lack of transparency in more advanced algorithms. GridSearchCV will be used to iterate through various hyper parameters of Random Forest Regression.\
